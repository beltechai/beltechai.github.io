          If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like
          marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent,
          or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
        </p>

        <p class="pq">How do I withdraw my consent?</p>

          If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your

          payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is
          necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is
          complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.

          Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed
          by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of
          brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.

          PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
          information by our store and its service providers..
